  Description :
  ---------------------
      Zabber is a PHP-based Jabber client library. You can easily build a bot
    on Google Talk / Openfire or other XMPP Servers by it. or more

      This version is a incomplete version ( but I hate decimal fraction lesser
    than 1 ), but it is so short (about 450 lines), and it accurate records of
    the entire conversation with the server, you can easily extend the class.
